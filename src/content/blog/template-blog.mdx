# Template Look

The template blog to show you how the blogs will look once I start adding it. Also I am going to build a CONTRIBUTE.md file if anyone wants to post their blog or want share something here or if they really want to contribute.

## Planning

- [x] Deploy the site
- [ ] Adding Back buttons and to make navigation easy across website
- [ ] Adding some blogs to blog page
- [ ] Handle blogs with thier tags and make blogs searchables by Tags
- [ ] Add some typographics by adding fonts

### Syntax checking out

**Bold** _italics_ ~underline~ [link](https://google.com) `code trik`

}
```
