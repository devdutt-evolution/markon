The discord bot🤖 is a command chat bot created for and on [<Image src="/socialIcons/discord.svg" alt="discord icon" width={16} height={16} class="inline-block not-prose" /> discord](https://discord.com/) platform.

So bots on discord are all command bot. Commands bot basically take some command📥 and arguments as input and perform some magic💫 or any other trick which it was suppose to do.
