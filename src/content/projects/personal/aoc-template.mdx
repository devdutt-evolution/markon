**AOC** in AOCtemplate stand for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) it is a website which hosts a coding hackathon at every year in the month🗓️ of october. It starts on 1️⃣<sup>st</sup> of october and ends on 31<sup>st</sup>.

During this month🗓️ each day you are provided with two problem statements and a large chunk of test data to run and test your solutions. After you are confident in your solution you have to make submission of your solution.

## <HoverUnder color='border-yellow-400'>Story</HoverUnder>

Now to participate in hackathon, You as a participant have to download↘️ the test file which has test cases, then copy©️ it in some type of project folder. And then to check your solution with the test cases file, you have to write a file reader function providing the path to the test file, then read it, parse it. This task you will have to perform for 31 days just to start testing a solution.

So to prevent this repetative task I created this CLI tool and made it available on package registry so that other can use the same [`aoctemplate`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aoctemplate).

With this CLI tool you can create your project folder and it will handel the file creation and reading of the data📰 from the input file. So now as a participant you🫵 only have to think about the problem statement and its solution😉.

## <HoverUnder color="border-yellow-400">About this package</HoverUnder>

This tool comes with two commands⌨️ <TagLook>aoc</TagLook> and other is <TagLook>aoc run</TagLook>.

\*\*aoc

<TagLook>aoc</TagLook> takes **\<folder_name\>** as argument and generates two files `input.txt` and `solution.js`.

**aoc run**

<TagLook>aoc run</TagLook> command takes **\<separator\>** as argument and reads the input file then will parse it and then will pass the parse data to your written solution.

### <HoverUnder color="border-yellow-400">Dependency</HoverUnder>

This package only has one dependency for coloring text on CLI.
