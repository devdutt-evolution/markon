This is my personal website to show case my skills, projects and put out any of my project, thoughts, learning out here on the
internetüåê.
This site has a sub subroute [/blogs](https://devdutt-portfolio.vercel.app/blogs) on which I will add my new learning or any problem or challenge I face.<br/ >
This blogs are written in **MDX format** and they are rendering in a template styles that are defined and all the blogs supports **meta tags** so they are well indexed also I am also planning to add ARIA tags, roles and description to the site for the accessibility.
Also this website by defaults ships **ZERO** Javascript to the client and the site is statically build at runtime as it is built using the Astro Framework. You can also check out the lighthouse score which is very close to üíØ btw.
