[Trocko](https://www.zaubacorp.com/company/TROCKO-LOGI-PRIVATE-LIMITED/U72900PN2015PTC157537) is a logistic and transportation company. They wanted to solve the inefficiency and delays in scheduling trips and logistics business and wanted to get a overall view of the fleets and their related realtime data.

So after many meetings, suggestions, research taking tips from established businesses we ended up deciding for two mobile applications one for drivers and one for the associated trocko fleet owners. And one admin dashboard such that admin can get total overall view of business and quality of deliveries realtime.

My role was as a Backend developer and technical buddy for the project. So from the backend side I got to contribute in designing all the database schemas decisions, API planning, to create a standard development pipeline such that both client side(trocko) and the development side can track and contribute to the product.
