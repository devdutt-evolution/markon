# <HoverUnder color="border-yellow-400">Fynds Cred Extention</HoverUnder>

An Extention for [CRED](https://cred.club/) on [Fynd platform](https://www.fynd.com/). We had to build a extention for CRED on [Fynd platform](https://www.fynd.com/platform/supply-chain/distributed-order-management-system) with which the CRED seller or CREDs client can handle their inventory and can track orders progress and can manage it.

So we were provided with extension template from fynd team and all the apis from CRED, and then we were asked to bridge the CRED apis with Fynds template extention such that all the features asked by CRED to work should work.
